Node.js APIs VS Browser APIs

Both allow Javascipt to do powerful things, but they run in different environments.

1. Execution Enviornment
Node.js APIs
Runs on= This will run on server/local machine
Contolled by= This will controlled by Node.js runtime
Access level= This will access full system access.

Browser APIs
Runs on= This will run on web browser only.
Controlled by = Browser (chrome, firefox,safari)
Access level=Limited(for security);


2.Core Purpose
Node.js APIs:- Backend logic , File system access, Server creation, Database handling
Browser APIs:- UI & user interaction, DOM manipulation, Rendering Web Pages, Event handling



Understanding Runtime Environments & Event Handling

1.What is a Runtime Environment?

A runtime environment is the platform where JavaScript code executes and provides APIs, libraries, and services required for execution.

JavaScript does not run alone — it always needs a runtime.

 Types of JavaScript Runtime Environments

Browser Runtime
Runs JavaScript inside a web browser
Managed by Chrome, Firefox, Safari
Provides Browser APIs

Node.js Runtime
Runs JavaScript on the server / local machine
Built on V8 engine
Provides Node.js APIs
